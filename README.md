# silent_auction
A simple program in Python for silent auctions, done as part of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code course, with some alterations

This code differs from Angela's by keeping track of the order of the bidders, and printing it in the console as to know how many bidders have made their bid so far. This is a very rudimentary beginner level program to practice dictionary manipulation in Python, as well as review basic concepts. It does not adhere to any specific programming design patterns or clean code recommendations.
